                  <AccordionPanel pb={4}>
                    Many events calculate the official time based on the time when the event officially started. The difference between chip time and gun time is quite simple.  Most awards are based on GUN TIME â€“ the time from the start of the race (gun) to when you cross the finish line as per IAAF, Athletics Canada, USATF, AIMS and International Awards standards. Chip Time is the time between when the athlete crossed the start mat and when the athlete reached the finish line.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Hereâ€™s an excerpt from the official rule book:
                    <br/>
                    <p
                      style={{    
                        backgroundColor:'#f5f5f5',
                        border:'1px solid #ccc',
                        padding:'5px'
                      }}
                    >
                      <strong>IAAF COMPETITION RULES 2014-2015 â€“ Art 165.24e</strong>
                      <br/>
                       Note: The official time shall be the time elapsed between the firing of the starting gun (or the synchronised start signal) and the athlete reaching the finish line. However, the time elapsed between an athlete crossing the start line and the finish line can be made known to him, but will not be considered an official time.
              
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    N.B. More events are now using only Chip time for results posting. However, the overall awards are still based on Gun time
